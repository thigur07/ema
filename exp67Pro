Connect the AC Supply to Kit. 
2. Ensure that all fault switches in normal position. 
3. Make the connections as shown in Block Diagram 
4. Connect 1KHz.Sine Wave signal to660nmFO Transmitter output and FO Receiver input. 
5. Connect 1Mtr. FO Cable between660nmFO Transmitter output and660nmFO Receiver 
input. 
6. Connect660nmFO Receiver output to AC Amplifier input. 
7. Set the switch SW3 to Analog Mode. 
8. Switch ON the power supply of the trainer. 
9. Observe the output signal at FO Receiver on CRO. 
10. Wind the 1 meter FO cable on the mandrel provided and observe the 
corresponding AC amplifier output on CRO. It will be gradually reducing showing loss 
due to bend
